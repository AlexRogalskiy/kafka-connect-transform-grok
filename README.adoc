== Description

The Apache KafkaÂ® SMT `io.streamthoughts.kafka.connect.transform.Grok` allows parsing unstructured data text into a data `Struct` from the entire key or value using
a Grok expression.

== Grok Basics

The syntax for a grok pattern is `%{SYNTAX:SEMANTIC}` or `%{SYNTAX:SEMANTIC:TYPE}`

The `SYNTAX` is the name of the pattern that should match the input text value.

The `SEMANTIC` is the field name for the data field that will contain the piece of text being matched.

The `TYPE` is the target type to which the data field must be converted.

Supported types are: ::
* `SHORT`
* `INTEGER`
* `LONG`
* `FLOAT`
* `DOUBLE`
* `BOOLEAN`
* `STRING`

The Kafka Connect Grok Transformer ships with a lot of reusable grok patterns. See the complete list of https://github.com/streamthoughts/kafka-connect-transform-grok/tree/main/src/main/resources/patterns[patterns].

== Debugging Gook Expression
You can build and debug your patterns using the useful online tools: http://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/[Grok Debug] and http://grokconstructor.appspot.com/[Grok Constructor].

== Regular Expressions
Grok sits on top of regular expressions, so any regular expressions are valid in grok as well.

The Grok SMT uses the regular expression https://github.com/jruby/joni[Joni] library which is the Java port of https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma[Oniguruma] regexp library used by the http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/[Elastic stack] (i.e Logstash).

== Custom Patterns

Sometimes, the patterns provided by the Grok SMT will not be sufficient to match your data.
Therefore, you have a few options to define custom patterns.

Option #1::
You can use the https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma[Oniguruma] syntax for _named capture_ which allows you to match a piece of text and capture it as a field:

[source]
----
(?<field_name>the regex pattern)
----

For example, if you need to capture parts of an email we can you the following pattern :
[source]
----
(?<EMAILADDRESS>(?<EMAILLOCALPART>^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+)(?<HOSTNAME>@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,6})$)
----

Configuration::
[source, properties]
----
transforms=Grok
transforms.Grok.type=io.streamthoughts.kafka.connect.transform.Grok$Value
transforms.Grok.match=(?<EMAILADDRESS>(?<EMAILLOCALPART>[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+)@(?<HOSTNAME>[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,6}))
----

_Note: The pattern `EMAILADDRESS` is already provided by the Grok SMT._

Option #2::

You can create a custom patterns file that will loaded the first time the Grok SMT is used :

For example, defining the pattern needed to parse NGINX access logs:::
* Create a directory (e.g. `grok-patterns`) with a file in it called `nginx`.
* Then, write the pattern you need in that file as: `<the pattern name><a space><the regexp for that pattern>`.

[source, bash]
----
$ mkdir ./grok-patterns
$ cat <<EOF > ./grok-patterns/nginx
NGINX_ACCESS %{IPORHOST:remote_addr} - %{USERNAME:remote_user} \[%{HTTPDATE:time_local}\] \"%{DATA:request}\" %{INT:status} %{NUMBER:bytes_sent} \"%{DATA:http_referer}\" \"%{DATA:http_user_agent}\"
EOF
----

Configuration::
[source, properties]
----
transforms=Grok
transforms.Grok.type=io.streamthoughts.kafka.connect.transform.Grok$Value
transforms.Grok.match=%{NGINX_ACCESS}
transforms.Grok.patternsDir=/tmp/grok-patterns
----
